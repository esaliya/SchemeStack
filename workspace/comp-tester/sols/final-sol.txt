; Final Take Home

The intent of this take-home final is to help you understand what our
compilers do and why.

Please keep each answer brief (AT MOST MOST 75 WORDS) and to the point. 
This will simplify our task when we grade your answers and keep us in good
humor, which is better for us and better for you.  Excessively long
answers will be marked down, as well as answers that contain the correct
answer but also contain off-topic or incorrect information.

You may consult with other students and post questions and _hints_ to the
message board, but your answers should be given _in your own words_.
You may use any other resources available to you, including the assignment
descriptions, lecture notes, online compiler, and your compiler.

Insert your answers into the text below, with each answer after the
corresponding problem statement, and submit your completed document, in
_plain ASCII text_, via the submission page as "takehome-final.txt", no
later than Wednesday at 11pm.

Prepare your submission with a text editor like vi or emacs, if you can. 
If you use Microsoft Word, be aware that it sometimes inserts special
characters into a document, e.g., for quotation marks, even when you save
the document as plain text.  If this happens, please fix the document
before you submit.

We anticipate that this exam will take anywhere from two to eight hours
depending on your starting level of understanding.

1. Describe how the "uncover conflict" passes determine that a conflict
   exists between two variables.
   
   In short, a conflict between two variables is determined when at the
   point of an assignment one is the assigned variable and the other is
   in the set of live variables. Live variables are the ones that are 
   known to be referred at the point of assignment excluding the assigned
   variable itself.

> mostly correct
> It is also important that we traverse the code backwards.
> for (set! x y), a conflict is not recorded between x and y

--------

2. Describe the special treatment call-live variables must receive that
   other variables need not receive.
   
   The values of the call-live variables might be needed even after the
   call returns. Therefore, these values need to be stored in the stack
   prior to invoking the function. Also the stack pointer should be lifted
   appropriately. If we don't push these to the stack then we will have
   to force the locations of these variables as live for the call, which
   will constraint the location assignment for the called procedure.

3. Describe how the compiler arranges to put tail-call arguments into
   the proper register and frame locations.
   
   It first adheres to the calling conventions, i.e. marks a local 
   assignment with "set!" of each argument to its proper register
   or frame-var based on conventions. These locations are then
   marked as live for the tail call. This marking guarantees that
   these locations will not get conflicted with local variable
   allocations of the callee.

4. Describe what a basic block is and how basic blocks are represented
   in our compilers.
   
   A basic block is a block of flat (no nesting of "if" and "begin")
   code where execution flows through a sequence of steps from top to
   bottom. The exit at the bottom is always a jump (may be conditional)
   to another block.
   
   Basic blocks are represented as top level letrec bound labeled 
   thunks until assembly code generation in our compiler. In the 
   generated assembly they are labeled blocks of code with jumps
   at the end. 

> correct
> the body of the letrec is an unlabeled basic block

5. Describe what closure conversion does.

   In essence this pass captures meta-data necessary to make each procedure
   closed, i.e. to make them contain no free variables. The meta-data 
   is wrapped inside two forms, "closures" and "bind-free". The former has
   information to create the closure bindings for the original variables
   that bound procedures. The latter is inside each procedure and
   has information to retrieve the values of its originally free variables.   

> mostly correct
> should say that closure contains code pointer
> should mention that the closure is passed as an additional argument

--------

6. Describe what assignment conversion does.
   
   The idea is to enable sharing the location an assigned variable
   across procedure boundaries. It does so by making the the 
   particular location explicit by boxing it inside the car of a
   cons cell. The original variable will now hold the ptr for the 
   pair. Any references to it will be marked as a reference to the
   car of that pair. The original set! form is now handled with
   the converted set-car! form.

7. At a high level, list the compiler changes required to add a division
   operator to the source language, ignoring passes where all primitives
   (or all value primitives) are treated alike.
   
   Assuming integer division with 1 word integers two passes have to 
   handle division separately. Division takes implicit registers
   (at least AX and AL). So select-instructions has to assign the
   dividend explicitly to AX by first assigning any existing value
   to of AX and AL to variables. The result should then be copied
   from AL to particular target variable. The original values should
   then be restored back to AX and AL. The next pass is generate-x84-64,
   which has to issue the IDVIQ instruction for division.

> specify-representation also requires changes
> excessively long (84 words)

8. Here is a box-and-pointer diagram of a Scheme value consisting of
   a pair whose car is the fixnum 7 and whose cdr is a closure with one
   free variable whose value is the fixnum 3.

   pair                  closure
   +-------+-------+     +-------+-------+
   |   7   |   x---+---->|   x   |   3   |
   +-------+-------+     +---+---+-------+
                             |
                             v
                            code

   A Scheme expression that produces this value is
     
     (let ([a 3]) (cons 7 (lambda () a)))

   Consider the second box-and-pointer diagram below:

      procedure             procedure
      +-------+-------+     +-------+-------+-------+
   +->|   x   |   x---+---->|   x   |   x   |   x   |
   |  +---+---+-------+     +---+---+---+---+---+---+
   |      |                     |       |       |
   |      v                     v       |       |
   |     code                  code     |       v
   +------------------------------------+       +-------+-------+
                                                |   3   |   ()  |
                                                +-------+-------+
                            
   Write down a source-language expression that evaluates to the value
   illustrated by the second diagram.

   Assume that no challenge-assignment passes are run.
   
   Solution:
   
     (let ([p (cons 3 ())])
       (letrec ([f (lambda (p) (if (eq? (car p) 3) p (g)))]
                [g (lambda () (f p))])
         (g)))

> mostly correct
> this evaluates to just a pair, i.e., (3).
> replacing (g) with f in the body would fix it

9. Consider the following nonterminating UIL program.

   (letrec ([f$2 (lambda (cp.5 x.3)
                   (locals ()
                     (begin
                       (mset! (mref cp.5 14) -1
                         (- 0 (mref (mref cp.5 14) -1)))
                       (f$2 (mref cp.5 6)
                            (+ x.3 (mref (mref cp.5 14) -1))))))])
     (locals (y.4 y.1 t.7 t.8 t.9 f.2 t.6)
       (begin
         (set! y.4 8)
         (set! y.1
           (begin
             (set! t.7 y.4)
             (set! t.8 30)
             (set! t.9 (+ (alloc 16) 1))
             (mset! t.9 -1 t.7)
             (mset! t.9 7 t.8)
             t.9))
         (set! f.2
           (begin
             (set! t.6 (+ (alloc 24) 2))
             (mset! t.6 -2 f$2)
             t.6))
         (mset! f.2 6 f.2)
         (mset! f.2 14 y.1)
         (f$2 f.2 136))))

   Write down a source-language program for which the week 15 online
   compiler (with default settings) produces the UIL program above. 
   (Your compiler should produce a similar UIL program with the
   standard helpers.ss object-layout definitions.)
   
   Solution:
   
   (let ([y 1])
     (let ([y (cons y '(void))])
       (letrec ([f (lambda (x)
                    (set-car! y (- 0 (car y)))
                    (f (+ x (car y))))])
         (f 17))))

> correct
> This will give you different labels. You could get the same labels
> and names if you removed the explicit assignment conversion.

10. Study the expression below.

    (letrec ([f (lambda (v)
                  (letrec ([g (lambda (i)
                                (if (= i (vector-length v))
                                    '()
                                    (cons 5 (g (+ i 1)))))])
                    (g 3)))])
      (f (make-vector 8)))

    Fill in the blanks:

    10a. The value of this expression is (5 5 5 5 5).
         (Work out by hand first, then verify by running.)

    10b. f is called 1 time.

    10c. g is called 6 times.

    10d. 2 closures are allocated.

    10e. 5 pairs are allocated.

    10f. 1 vector is allocated.

    10g. 23 (9 for vector, 10 for 5 pairs, 1 for f's closure, and 3 for g's closure)
         total words are allocated in the heap.
         (Show how you came up with that answer.)

    10h. The stack will get 5 frames deep by virtue of calls
         initiated by (f (make-vector 8)).

    Assume that no challenge-assignment passes are run.

    Hint: It will help to trace by hand the sequence of calls and while
    doing so draw diagrams of the stack and each allocated object.

    Hint: You can verify your answers by tracing f, g, and (in the
    language wrapper for one of the passes) alloc, so there's no excuse
    not to get each of these answers correct.
